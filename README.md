Basic TODO App Created Using React

The main purpose of this project was to practice:
* state management
* the "? :" conditional operator for CSS classes

There are still things TODO such as:
* add a light/dark mode
* add a selector element so that we can filter between ALL and COMPLETED tasks
* allow the ability to restore deleted tasks incase we accidentally delete something we need still need TODO
