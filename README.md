Basic TODO App Created Using React

The main purpose of this project was to practice:
* state management
* the "? :" conditional operator for CSS classes

There are still things TODO such as:
* enable localStorage so that if we refresh the page we do not lose our list
* add a light/dark mode
* add a selector element so that we can filter between ALL and COMPLETED tasks
* allow the ability to restore deleted tasks incase we accidentally delete something we need still need TODO
* general styling things such as
*   -- Fix List so that each item aligns nicely
*   -- LI is not centered how I would like it to be




GENERAL NOTES:

Again, this is just practice for React and general functionality, not CSS.
